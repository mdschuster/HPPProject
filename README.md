# HPP Project
This project is for a colloquia/workshop on cellular automata fluid dyanamics.

It covers the implemention of the HPP model using JavaFX.

## Getting Started
The first few slides of the presentation (CA_HPP.pdf) describe the tools and requirements needed to create the game. A brief list is here:

* A code editor that can be used to write Java
* Java 1.8+
* A version of JavaFX installed

If you have trouble getting the `HPP_Starter` project imported into your IDE of choice, just create a new JavaFX project and copy in the two source files mentioned below.

## File Organization
***Starter Code***  
Most of the files in this repo are created by the Eclipse project itself. The starter code files are located in `HPP_Starter/src/application`.  
* `Main.java:` Main class that contains all of the simulation code, including collision and propagation of the particles.
* `GridElement.java:` GridElement class that contains the information to represent each grid element. This includes the JavaFX graphics.

***Completed project***  
The files in `HPP` contain the completed JavaFX project for reference.
